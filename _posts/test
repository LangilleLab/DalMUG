The microbiome has been connected to several human cancers, namely those involving the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically in colorectal cancer (CRC), changes in both fecal and mucosal microbiome have been reported and theorized to play a role in CRC pathogenesis (shown recently [here](http://gut.bmj.com/content/66/4/633)).
